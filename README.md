Computer Vision Package
is a project for image processing using C# Windows Form Application

There Is A 4 Project in this Package
1 - AdditionalForms << Project For Additional Windows Form For Other Component
2- Computer Vision Package << Main Project Contain Multiple Classes of 3 Types
   1 - Filter << This Class Implement The Filters 
   2 - ImageEnhancement << This Class For Controlling All Image Enhancement Algorithm
   3 - ObjectDetectionAlgorithm << this class For Object Detection Algorithms
   Note : if the filter or image enhancement or object detection algorithms need an input before run This Can be Done by add an additional Form For this algorithm

3- ControlingClasses << Class For Main Work Classes

4- HelperFunctionality << class for global functions and global classes
